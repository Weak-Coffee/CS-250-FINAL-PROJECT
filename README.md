# Module Eight Journal

# 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How do creating "user stories" help with this?

I think this is a skill that will take time to hone and develop. Having a good baseline of communication with the users will help with learning their desires. User stories help by streamlining the client needs and wants. 

# 2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile process do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

After everything I have learned about Agile I think it is the best project managment tool to use. The way agile is strucked makes for the most streamlined and collaborative enviornment, which are two things that are important to me. Incorporating tools like Azure boards and Git into my future development work would be key to being sucsessful. Using scrum to break down the development cycle into more managable bits will make growing my skill easier. 

# 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

To me being a good team member is always being positive and helping where you can. This is a high collaboration high scress industry. I think working with people that are good team plays is very important. You must also share the same goal. If you're not all working towards the same finish line it can be a hindrance to completing your project.  The drive to always learn and grow also make a good team member. You should always be looking to grow your skills to become more useful to your team.
